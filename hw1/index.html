		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		
		<p>To rasterize a triangle, I use the line test method based on 2D cross products.</p>	
		
		<p>
		I first compute the bounding box of the triangle using the three vertices. This gives the range of pixels that might contain parts of the triangle.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		For each integer pixel coordinate (x, y) in the bounding box, I compute the sample position at the center of the pixel (x + 0.5, y + 0.5).	
		</p>

		<p>
		For each sample point, I use three edge tests. Each test uses a 2D cross product to determine which side of an edge the sample lies on. If the sample lies on the same side of all three edges or directly on them, it is inside the triangle. This handles all triangle winding orders (clockwise or counter-clockwise) and draws pixels.
		</p>
			
		<p>
		My algorithm is no worse than sampling every pixel in the bounding box because I use the bounding box only computed by min() and max() of the triangle’s vertex coordinates. Also, I only check sample points within this bounding box, not the entire framebuffer. For each sample in the bounding box, I run a point-in-triangle test.
		</p>

		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
				
		<p>
		Supersampling is an anti-aliasing technique that reduces jagged edges (aliasing) by sampling multiple points within each pixel and averaging their colors. Instead of sampling just the center of each pixel, we sample a finer grid within the pixel and blend the results to get smoother edges. Aliasing artifacts occur because we're representing high-frequency visual information (like sharp edges or fine lines) with too few samples. Supersampling mitigates this by effectively increasing the resolution and then downsampling, preserving edge quality.
		</p>	
		
		<p>
		I use sample_buffer, a 1D std::vector<Color>, which stores color values for all subpixel samples. It has width * height * sample_rate entries. Each pixel stores sample_rate subsamples, laid out row-wise (e.g., 4 samples per pixel for 2x2 grid). Note that index = (y * width + x) * sample_rate + (j * sqrt_rate + i) where (i, j) is the subpixel position inside the sqrt_rate x sqrt_rate grid for that pixel.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		For each integer pixel coordinate (x, y) in the bounding box, I compute the sample position at the center of the pixel (x + 0.5, y + 0.5).	
		</p>

		<p>
		Instead of testing a single point at (x + 0.5, y + 0.5), I test sqrt(sample_rate)^2 points within each pixel. Each subpixel sample is tested for coverage using a helper function, inside_tri(...), and written to the appropriate index in sample_buffer.
		</p>
			
		<p>
		After all triangles are rasterized, this function averages the colors of all subpixel samples for each pixel, then writes the averaged color to rgb_framebuffer_target.
		</p>

		<p>
		For lines and points, we write the same color to all subsamples within a pixel, since high-quality antialiasing for lines wasn’t required.
		</p>

		<p> 
		To summarize the antialiasing process, each triangle is rasterized by evaluating multiple subpixel sample positions per pixel. Then, a sample is filled if it lies inside the triangle. After rasterizing all triangles, resolve_to_framebuffer() computes the final pixel color by averaging all the subpixel colors. This smooths out triangle edges and eliminates jaggedness, especially at shallow or steep angles.

		</div>

		<p> 
		These images demonstrate the impact of sample_rate on rendering quality. A higher sample_rate means more color samples are taken per pixel, leading to a more accurate average color. This increased precision significantly reduces aliasing artifacts, resulting in noticeably smoother edges and finer detail representation in the rendered image.
		</p>




			
		<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>

		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
		
		<p>
		Barycentric coordinates allow us to express any point inside a triangle as a weighted average of its three vertices. If we denote the triangle's vertices as \( P_0, P_1, P_2 \), then any arbitrary point \( P \) within the triangle can be represented as:
		</p>

		<div class="equation">
            	\[ P = \alpha P_0 + \beta P_1 + \gamma P_2 \]
        	</div>
		
		<P>
		Here, \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \) are the weighting factors of each vertex. The sum of these three values always equals 1 (\( \alpha + \beta + \gamma = 1 \)). For points inside the triangle, all \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \) values will be between 0 and 1.
		</P>

			<figcaption>Barycentric applied to a triangle with one red, one green, and one blue vertex</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>
		As shown in the image below, when the three vertices of a triangle are assigned distinct colors (e.g., red, green, blue), the interior of the triangle displays a smooth blend of these colors. This occurs because the \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \) values from the barycentric coordinate system are used to interpolate the colors based on the point's proximity to each vertex.

		<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>

		<p>
		In 3D graphics, texture mapping is the process of applying a 2D image (texture) to the surface of a 3D model. When rendering, each pixel on the screen corresponds to a specific point on the 3D model's surface, which in turn maps to a specific coordinate within the 2D texture. The process of determining the color of a screen pixel based on this texture coordinate is called **pixel sampling**.
		</p>

		<p>
		To perform texture mapping, my implementation iterates through each pixel (and sub-pixel for supersampling) within the triangle's bounding box. For each such point, we first compute its 2D texture coordinates (u, v) using barycentric interpolation from the triangle's vertices.
		</p>

		<p>
		Once we have the interpolated (u, v) coordinates, we sample with the desired sampling method, P_NEAREST or P_LINEAR.
		</p>

		<p>
		"Nearest Neighbor Sampling" directly selects the color of the single texel (texture pixel) that is closest to that coordinate for a given (u, v) texture coordinate. 
		</p>

		<p>
		"Bilinear Interpolation" computes a weighted average of the colors of the four texels surrounding the given (u, v) texture coordinate. The weights are determined by how close the coordinate is to each of the four surrounding texels.
		</p>
			
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="nearest_sample1.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Nearest sample, rate = 1</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="bilinear_sample1.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Bilinear sample, rate = 1</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="nearest_sample16.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Nearest sample, rate = 16</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="bilinear_sample16.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Bilinear sample, rate = 16</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>
		The choice between Nearest Neighbor and Bilinear Interpolation significantly impacts the visual quality of the rendered texture. As we can notice from the above images, Nearest Neighbor is faster but produces jaggy appearances, especially when textures are magnified. Bilinear Interpolation, while slightly slower, offers a smoother, more natural look by blending colors, reducing jaggedness and aliasing.
		</p>

		<p>
		The visual difference becomes large when textures are magnified, as Nearest Neighbor clearly shows individual texels while Bilinear provides a softer and blended result. The differences can also be found in texture minification or with sharp texture details, where Bilinear effectively avoids aliasing artifacts like shimmering or stair-stepping.
		</p>
